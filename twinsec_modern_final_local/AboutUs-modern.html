                <p>Security services are used by many industries to protect their assets, being their customers, employees, real estate, facilities, etc. Although, many industries use security services to protect these assets, the manner in which services are provided to each industry needs to be tailored specifically for each one of them. One security officer patrolling a shopping center, for instance, has different duties to perform than a security service patrolling a hospital, or a school, or a night club.</p>
                
                <p>At Twins Security Services, we feel that no company or organization should limit itself to receive a security service that does not accommodate its needs. For that reason, we strive to provide services that are designed specifically for each individual client, and do everything possible to ensure complete satisfaction. When hiring a security service agency we recommend you consider the following:</p>
                
                <ul class="industry-list" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 30px auto;">
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong class="text-gold">Customization</strong> - Look for an agency that is flexible and sensitive and is willing to customize a program that fits your specific needs. The first action Twins Security Services will take is to survey your needs to develop a security service program to achieve the desired goals.</li>
                    
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong class="text-gold">Training</strong> - The success in securing your assets depends on the level and quality of training of your security service provider. Twins Security Services staff trains with reputable academies such as ROYAL SECURITY ACADEMY and FIRE ARMS ACADEMY to ensure the proper techniques are implemented.</li>
                    
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong class="text-gold">Expertise</strong> - The success of your security program depends immensely on the experience of your security services provider. Since 1993, Twins Security Services has served many clients in different industries giving us the expertise necessary to guarantee the success of your program.</li>
                    
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong class="text-gold">Regulations</strong> - Your security service provider must follow the regulations of the governing entities and have the necessary legal documentation.
                        <ul style="margin-top: 10px; margin-left: 20px; list-style-type: circle;">
                            <li>Twins Security Services is licensed by Consumer Affairs.</li>
                            <li>Twins Security Services is insured with the appropriate liability insurance guaranteeing delivery of services to ANY type of business or industry.</li>

                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"><strong class="text-gold">Qualified Staff</strong> - The same way your organization should not accept a one size fits all approach to service delivery, the staff that provides services to your organization should always be the best fit for your organization. Twins Security Services strives to provide your organization with the most qualified security staff to fulfill your needs.</li>
                </ul>
